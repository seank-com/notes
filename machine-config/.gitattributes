# .gitattributes â€“ Windows-friendly defaults + Unity safety rails
#
# Goal:
# - Human text (.cs, .md, .txt, .html, etc.) behaves nicely with core.autocrlf=true
# - Unity/machine-parsed files NEVER get line ending conversion (fragile)
# - Obvious binaries are treated as binary (no EOL conversion, no diffs)

# --- General text (let Git normalize CRLF->LF on commit; checkout per platform) ---
# You can add more here as needed for your stacks.

# --- Catch-alls / safety ---
# If you ever hit a fragile format, add it above as '-text' to prevent conversion.
# You can also uncomment the next line to default everything to binary and whitelist text instead:
# * binary
# (If you do that, be sure to keep the text whitelist above.)
